I've been tried many operating systems, such as Windows, macOS and several Linux distributions. All of them have their own advantagies that makes me unable to stop using every one of them. For example, I will need Windows for gaming and Ubuntu for Deep Learning related projects.
But if I have to choose one as my favorite OS, I would choose Arch Linux. The reason is simple, it just gives me full control over the system and the community of Arch Linux is amazing. I am saying that it has no limit. On the contrary, I've been facing a lot of problems during the time using Arch Linux and there are even some that I haven't solved yet.
In this post, I would like to track some problems I solved as a reference for you and future me.
